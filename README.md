# Spring-MVC-Blog
### My first web app built with Java and Spring

---

## Project Notes
- I am using the tutorial available at [nakov.com](http://www.nakov.com/blog/2016/08/05/creating-a-blog-system-with-spring-mvc-thymeleaf-jpa-and-mysql/) as an initial guideline.


## To Do

- figure out this error, where the culprit lies between /src/resources/templates/index.html and src/resources/templates/layout.html :
``` 
This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.

There was an unexpected error (type=Internal Server Error, status=500).
Exception parsing document: template="index", line 2 - column 16
```
